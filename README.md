# ALC 4 Phase 1 Challenge

The aim of the challenge was to create three activities, A, B and C.
The first activity (A) contains two buttons.



#### Button 1 takes you to Activity B when clicked.
#### Button 2 takes you to Activity C when clicked.

Activity B is the About ALC page.
It contains only a Webview that loads the URL https://andela.com/alc/ which is the ALC about page.
Activity C is my profile.
It contains an ImageView which should display my photo, TextViews showing my name, Track, Country, Email and Phone Number.
